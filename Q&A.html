                        <h3>1. What type of work can I do on a Student Visa (Tier 4 / Student Route)?</h3>
                        <p>International students on a Student Visa can work a maximum of <strong>20 hours per week during term time</strong> and <strong>full-time during university holidays</strong>. However, you cannot be self-employed, work in a full-time permanent role, or work as a professional sportsperson or entertainer. Always check your visa vignette and BRP for exact conditions, as breaches can result in visa cancellation.</p>

                        <h3>2. What is the UK Graduate Route visa?</h3>
                        <p>The Graduate Route is a post-study work visa that allows international students who have successfully completed an eligible degree in the UK to remain in the country for <strong>2 years (or 3 years for PhD graduates)</strong> to work or look for work at any skill or salary level. The visa does <strong>not require sponsorship</strong>, and you can work full-time, be self-employed, or freelance. However, the visa is not extendable, and you must switch to another visa (e.g. Skilled Worker) to remain after it expires.</p>

                    <div class="faq-card">
                        <h3>3. Can I switch from a Student Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, you can apply to switch from a Student Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa <strong>from within the UK</strong> if you have completed your degree or are within 3 months of completing it. To be eligible, you must have a job offer from a UK employer that is a <strong>licensed sponsor</strong>, and the job must meet specific <strong>salary and skill level thresholds</strong>. Switching to this route can lead to permanent residency after 5 years, making it a common option for graduates.</p>

                    <div class="faq-card">
                        <h3>4. Which employers sponsor Skilled Worker Visas?</h3>
                        <p>Only employers listed on the UK government‚Äôs official <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers" target="_blank">Register of Licensed Sponsors</a> can sponsor Skilled Worker visas. These include many large corporations, consulting firms, tech companies, and NHS trusts. However, not all jobs in these organisations are sponsored ‚Äî you must apply for a role explicitly stating that sponsorship is available. Tools like Student Circus and Handshake (university portals) often filter jobs with sponsorship eligibility.</p>

                        <h3>5. What is the minimum salary required for a Skilled Worker visa?</h3>
                        <p>As of April 2024, the general salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is <strong>¬£38,700 per year</strong> (or ¬£15.88 per hour). However, if you're applying as a ‚Äúnew entrant‚Äù (usually under 26 or recently graduated), the threshold may be lower ‚Äî around <strong>¬£30,960</strong>. Jobs on the <strong>Shortage Occupation List</strong> or in health and education sectors may also qualify for reduced salary thresholds. These rules are complex, so always check the latest Home Office guidance or consult an immigration advisor.</p>

                        <h3>6. Can I work full-time after graduation while waiting for my Graduate Route visa?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. If you apply for the Graduate Route visa <strong>before your Student Visa expires</strong>, you can legally remain in the UK and work full-time while awaiting a decision. This is known as being under ‚ÄúSection 3C leave.‚Äù However, you must not travel outside the UK until a decision is made, as leaving the country will cancel your application automatically.</p>

                        <h3>7. Can I start a business on a Student or Graduate Route visa?</h3>
                        <p>On a Student Visa, <strong>you cannot be self-employed or engage in business activity</strong>. This includes freelancing, running a business, or even being a company director. On the Graduate Route, however, you <strong>can be self-employed or freelance</strong>. You can start a business (except in restricted sectors like financial regulation) as long as you comply with UK tax and business laws. For tech founders, a Start-up or Innovator Founder visa may be more appropriate for long-term scaling and residency options.</p>

                        <h3>8. What happens if I lose my job on a Skilled Worker Visa?</h3>
                        <p>If you lose your job while on a Skilled Worker Visa, your sponsor must inform the Home Office. You will then usually have <strong>60 days (or until your visa expiry date, whichever is sooner)</strong> to find another sponsor and apply for a new visa. If you cannot secure sponsorship within that time, you must leave the UK. It's critical to act quickly and consult with an immigration advisor if you find yourself in this situation.</p>

                    <div class="faq-card">
                        <h3>9. Can I bring dependents on a Graduate Route or Skilled Worker Visa?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. You can bring dependents (partner and children under 18) on both the Graduate Route and the Skilled Worker visa. For the Graduate Route, dependents must have been in the UK as your Student Visa dependents. For the Skilled Worker visa, dependents can apply with you or join you later, provided you meet financial maintenance requirements. Dependents have full work rights (except as a sportsperson) and can also study in the UK.</p>

                        <h3>10. Does working part-time during studies count toward permanent residency (ILR)?</h3>
                        <p>No. Time spent in the UK on a Student Visa, including part-time or full-time work during studies, <strong>does not count</strong> toward the 5-year residency requirement for <strong>Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)</strong>. Only time on qualifying visas such as Skilled Worker, Global Talent, Innovator Founder, or certain family visas counts. The earliest route to ILR typically begins once you switch to a post-study qualifying visa.</p>

                        <h2>Can I work in the UK after I graduate?</h2>
                        <p>Yes, many international students can. The main route is the <strong>Graduate Route visa</strong>, which allows you to stay in the UK for 2 years (3 for PhDs) to work or look for work. You don't need a job offer to apply. Another option is the <strong>Skilled Worker visa</strong>, which requires a job offer from a licensed sponsor. Our advisors can provide detailed information on eligibility.</p>

                        <h2>How many hours can I work during my studies?</h2>
                        <p>For degree-level courses, you can typically work up to <strong>20 hours per week during term time</strong> and full-time during official vacations. It is crucial to check the specific conditions on your visa (BRP) as restrictions vary. Working over your permitted hours is a serious breach of visa conditions.</p>

                        <h2>How do I find companies that sponsor visas?</h2>
                        <p>The UK Home Office has a public <strong>register of licensed sponsors</strong> online. Many large graduate employers are also on this list. Our Careers Service provides workshops and resources to help you identify these employers. We also host careers fairs where you can speak directly with companies that hire international graduates.</p>

                        <h2>Are CVs different in the UK?</h2>
                        <p>Yes. In the UK, a CV is usually a maximum of two pages. It's standard practice <strong>not to include a photograph, date of birth, or marital status</strong>. The focus is on your skills, experience, and achievements. A tailored cover letter is also highly recommended. We offer CV review services to help you adapt your documents to UK standards.</p>

                            <h3>1. What is a graduate scheme in the UK?</h3>
                            <p>Graduate schemes are structured, full-time programmes for recent graduates, usually lasting 1‚Äì3 years. They offer formal training, rotational placements, and often lead to permanent roles. Large employers across sectors ‚Äî from finance and consulting to tech and engineering ‚Äî run these schemes. Applications typically open up to a year in advance.</p>

                            <h3>2. Do graduate schemes sponsor international students?</h3>
                            <p>Some graduate schemes do offer Skilled Worker visa sponsorship, especially in sectors like banking, consulting, tech, and engineering. However, not all companies are licensed sponsors. Always check the job listing and the company‚Äôs visa policy. Use filtered job boards like Student Circus to find sponsor-friendly employers.</p>

                            <h3>3. When do I need to apply for graduate schemes?</h3>
                            <p>Most graduate schemes open for applications between August and October, for roles starting the following year. Deadlines can be as early as November, and some schemes close applications once enough candidates have progressed. Applying early increases your chances of success.</p>

                            <p>The process usually involves an online application, psychometric tests, video interviews, and an assessment centre. These stages assess your skills, aptitude, communication, and leadership potential. Preparation and familiarity with UK recruitment expectations are key to progressing through the stages.</p>

                            <h3>5. What are alternatives if I don‚Äôt get into a graduate scheme?</h3>
                            <p>Graduate schemes are competitive, and many roles outside of them are also open to international students. Consider applying to entry-level roles at smaller companies, internships, or short-term contracts. You can also work under the Graduate Route visa, then apply for Skilled Worker sponsorship later. Building transferable skills is more important than the label of the job.</p>
